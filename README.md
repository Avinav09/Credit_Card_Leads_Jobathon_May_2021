## Credit Card Lead Prediction

Happy Customer Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products, like Savings accounts, Current accounts, investment products, credit products, among other offerings.

The bank also cross-sells products to its existing customers and to do so they use different kinds of communication like tele-calling, e-mails, recommendations on net banking, mobile banking, etc. 

In this case, the Happy Customer Bank wants to cross sell its credit cards to its existing customers. The bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards.

Now, the bank is looking for your help in identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card, given:
- Customer details (gender, age, region etc.)
- Details of his/her relationship with the bank (Channel_Code,Vintage, 'Avg_Asset_Value etc.)

- Channel_Code: A customer acquisition channel is any place your customers meet your brand for the first time â€” whether through social media, organic search, or a paid ad. Customer acquisition channels are how you bring in new customers.

- Vintage: Vintage is a colloquial term used to describe mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that have been "seasoned." That is, they've been issued long enough, and enough on-time payments have been made, that the risk of default is lower. Vintage is the age of an item as it relates to the year it was created.
